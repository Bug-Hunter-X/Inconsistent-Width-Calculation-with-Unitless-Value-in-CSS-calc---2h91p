The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error: using a unitless value for the `width` property within a `calc()` function where a unit is expected. This can lead to unexpected results or rendering issues across different browsers.

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% + 200);
}
```

The problem is the `200` value.  It's missing a unit (px, em, rem, etc.), causing inconsistencies in how browsers interpret and calculate the final width.
