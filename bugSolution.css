To fix this, always ensure that all values within the `calc()` function have units that are consistent.  Here's the corrected code:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% + 200px);
}
```

Now, `200px` explicitly states that the value is 200 pixels, leading to consistent width calculation across different browsers. You can use any appropriate unit (like `em`, `rem`, etc.) depending on your context.
